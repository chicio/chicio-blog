*A strong foundation in data structures and algorithms is essential. Here’s how I decided to revisit the fundamentals and turn them into my own DSA course.*

In the past few months, life and work have kept me quite busy, so I haven’t been publishing much here on the blog.  
Still, that doesn’t mean nothing has changed. In fact, my website went through a full transformation since the beginning of the year:

- migrated from Gatsby to Next.js  
- moved from GitHub Pages to Vercel  
- redesigned the UI completely with a "Matrix-inspired" aesthetic I’d always wanted and loved  

Even if I haven’t written many new posts, I’ve been quite active behind the scenes. 
One thing I’ve been enjoying lately in my free time is solving **LeetCode problems**.  
Why? Because even after almost **20 years in this industry**, and despite the rapid progress of **AI** (which seems ready to automate parts of programming we once considered indispensable), I’ve come to realize that **a solid grasp of algorithms and data structures is still invaluable**.  

A well-grounded understanding of time complexity, memory efficiency, and fundamental problem-solving patterns doesn’t just make you a better engineer, it reshapes the way you *think*.  
Recently, I’ve been following the [Algomaster.io DSA patterns list](https://algomaster.io/practice/dsa-patterns), a curated set of 300 problems created by [Ashish Pratap](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ashishps1/), designed to cover all the essential algorithmic concepts. I’ve already crossed the **200-problem milestone**, and the journey has been amazing so far (even if most of the time I scream at the monitor while saying "why I didn't think about this solution by my own???").  

That’s what inspired me to create **my own mini-course on Data Structures and Algorithms**, following the Algomaster groupings (with some custom additions). 
My goal is to build a **centralized reference**, a place I can come back to when I want to revisit key concepts, without having to dig through countless resources online.

And here’s the twist: unlike years ago, when I’d have spent days writing everything from scratch, this time **AI**, the tool that many fear will replace us, have been an *incredible partner* in building this material faster and more effectively than ever.  
The course is still a **work in progress**, but below you’ll find the topics I’ve already covered. I’ll continue to expand it as I progress through the [Algomaster.io](https://algomaster.io/practice/dsa-patterns) challenges, aiming to eventually complete all 300 problems.

So go ahead, bookmark the [roadmap page that you can find here](/data-structures-and-algorithms).
Check back from time to time. Whether you’re preparing for interviews, sharpening your fundamentals, or just rediscovering the beauty of algorithms, I hope this journey will inspire you too :heart:.
