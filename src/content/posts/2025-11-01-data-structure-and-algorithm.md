*A strong foundation in data structures and algorithms is essential. Here’s how I decided to revisit the fundamentals and turn them into my own DSA course.*

In the past few months, life and work have kept me quite busy, so I haven’t been publishing much here on the blog.  
Still, that doesn’t mean nothing has changed. In fact, my website went through a full transformation since the beginning of the year:

- migrated from Gatsby to Next.js  
- moved from GitHub Pages to Vercel  
- redesigned the UI completely with a "Matrix-inspired" aesthetic I’d always wanted and loved  

Even if I haven’t written many new posts, I’ve been quite active behind the scenes. 
One thing I’ve been enjoying lately in my free time is solving **LeetCode problems**.  
Why? Because even after almost **20 years in this industry**, and despite the rapid progress of **AI** (which seems ready to automate parts of programming we once considered indispensable), I’ve come to realize that **a solid grasp of algorithms and data structures is still invaluable**.  
A well-grounded understanding of time complexity, memory efficiency, and fundamental problem-solving patterns doesn’t just make you a better engineer, it reshapes the way you *think*.  
Recently, I’ve been following the [Algomaster.io DSA patterns list](https://algomaster.io/practice/dsa-patterns), a curated set of 300 problems created by [Ashish Pratap](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ashishps1/), designed to cover all the essential algorithmic concepts. I’ve already crossed the **200-problem milestone**, and the journey has been amazing so far (even if most of the time I scream at the monitor while saying "why I didn't think about this solution by my own???").  
That’s what inspired me to create **my own mini-course on Data Structures and Algorithms**, following the Algomaster groupings (with some custom additions). 
My goal is to build a **centralized reference**, a place I can come back to when I want to revisit key concepts, without having to dig through countless resources online.
And here’s the twist: unlike years ago, when I’d have spent days writing everything from scratch, this time **AI**, the tool that many fear will replace us, have been an *incredible partner* in building this material faster and more effectively than ever.  
The course is still a **work in progress**, but below you’ll find the topics I’ve already covered. I’ll continue to expand it as I progress through the [Algomaster.io](https://algomaster.io/practice/dsa-patterns) challenges, aiming to eventually complete all 300 problems.

So go ahead, bookmark this page and check back from time to time.  
Whether you’re preparing for interviews, sharpening your fundamentals, or just rediscovering the beauty of algorithms, I hope this journey will inspire you too :heart:.
