# Queue & Monotonic Queue

## 1. Introduction
- What a queue is: FIFO data structure
- Core operations: enqueue, dequeue, peek
- Differences vs stack (FIFO vs LIFO)
- When a queue is the natural choice

## 2. Queue Fundamentals
- Conceptual model of a queue
- Common implementations:
  - Array-based queue
  - Circular queue
  - Linked-list-based queue
- Performance implications and common pitfalls
- Real-world intuition (buffering, scheduling, task processing)

## 3. Classic Queue Patterns
- Simulation problems (turns, processes, time-based events)
- Reordering and revealing elements
- Queue + index techniques
- When a simple queue is sufficient

## 4. Monotonic Queue
- Definition: queue maintaining a monotonic order
- Increasing vs decreasing monotonic queues
- Core invariant and why it works
- Why monotonic queues enable O(n) solutions

## 5. Common Tools and Techniques
- Using a deque instead of a simple queue
- Storing indices vs values
- Pairing values with positions
- Removing invalid or dominated elements
- Recognizing when a monotonic queue is required

## 6. Time & Space Complexity
- Complexity of standard queue operations
- Complexity of monotonic queue operations
- Amortized analysis intuition

## 7. Exercises
