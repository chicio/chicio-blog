# Bucket sort

- Overview of Bucket Sort
- When it is useful: sorting numbers with bounded range or frequency-based sorting
- Relation to counting sort and radix sort
- how does it works
-- Step 1: Create buckets (arrays, lists) to hold elements
-- Step 2: Scatter elements into buckets according to a mapping function
-- Step 3: Sort individual buckets (usually with insertion sort)
-- Step 4: Concatenate buckets
- Complexity analysis and why it can be O(n) for uniform distribution

## Practical Use Cases
- Sorting floating-point numbers in [0,1)
- Frequency counting (characters, words)
- Finding maximum gaps

## Time & Space Complexity
- Best case: O(n + k) where k is number of buckets
- Average case: O(n + n²/k + k)
- Worst case: O(n²) if all elements fall into the same bucket
- Space: O(n + k)
