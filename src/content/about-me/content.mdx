## Biography

Hello! I'm Fabrizio Duroni. I live in Como, Italy with my family, my girlfriend Chiara, and a lot of computers.  

I fell in love with technology when I was 7, after receiving my first [Game Boy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Boy "Game Boy") for Christmas. I still remember the first day I played [Super Mario Land 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Mario_Land_2:_6_Golden_Coins "Super Mario Land 2"), it was truly amazing.

My journey continued with another console, the [Nintendo NES](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_Entertainment_System "Nintendo NES"). Just to be clear, video games are one of my main hobbies. After the first two Nintendo consoles, I became a PlayStation fan and have owned every Sony console released since 1994.  

I got my first PC when I was 12, equipped with an AMD K5 processor (no Intel Pentium?!!! 😮) and 64 MB of RAM. I remember experimenting with it and discovering new things about computer science every day.  

I started programming at 14, beginning with Pascal in high school, then moving on to **C, Java, and PHP** during my bachelor's degree. In 2009, I fell in love with Apple 📱, and in 2010 I started developing iOS applications. That's why I’m passionate about **Swift** and **Objective-C**.  

Around the same time, I started my _internal struggle_ over which platform is best between Apple, Microsoft, or Linux, a debate that still isn’t over 😅.

In 2013, I started my master’s degree, specializing in **computer graphics**, the area of computer science I love most. This is also when I fell in love with **C++**. I’m also proficient in **JavaScript**, **TypeScript** , **Java** and **Kotlin**.  

I consider myself an experienced developer who enjoys his work immensely. 
Programming is both a challenge and a way to connect with brilliant people every day.

my work experiences, and the technologies I use daily. 

Maybe after reading this biography, you still have some questions about me. Here are some answers to the most common ones:

- **What does “Chicio” mean?** Chicio is my nickname for as long as I can remember. Everyone calls me that, and sometimes I almost forget it’s not my real name. Its origin remains a mystery 😜, but I really like it.
- **Why start a blog?** I started this blog in 2017 to keep track of my progress in programming, computer graphics, and computer science in general. As you can see the blog is still up and running, a testament to my perseverance. Once I start something, I never quit!
- **Why this website is inspired by “The Matrix” the movie?** Do I need to explain? It’s one of the greatest movies of all time! 😏 I even have the famous blue and red pills tattooed on my wrists. Over time, this website has evolved through several updates. I always wanted a “cool” portfolio site but feared it might seem childish. Now, time and self-confidence have helped me overcome that fear.  
The concept of *choice to seek and embrace the truth, even if it is harsh, difficult, and uncomfortable, symbolizing awakening and enlightenment* resonates deeply with me. Life sometimes feels like a cage, but we should strive to be unplugged.

- **How many other tattoos do I have?** I have many, covering completely my arms, legs, back, chest and ribs 😏.  
- **Is there anything beyond computer science?** Of course, Chiara (called also chiara, Clary, clary :laughing:), the most important person in my life 💘. 
I love music, especially rock and metal, and I attend many concerts. I also tried playing bass guitar for a few years, though not very successfully 😄.  
And yes, I still love video games. I’m a huge fan of everything Sony and Nintendo create (sorry Microsoft, I’ve never been an Xbox fan 😆).

## Technologies

Over {new Date().getFullYear() - 2008}+ years of experience building mobile and web applications, I've worked with a wide range of technologies. From iOS development with Swift and Objective-C to full-stack solutions with Spring Boot, React, and Kubernetes.

Here's an overview of my technical expertise and the tools I use to build performant, scalable applications 🚀.
