# Linked list

A **linked list** is a data structure consisting of nodes, where each node contains a value and a reference (pointer) to the next node. Unlike arrays, linked lists 
do **not store elements contiguously** in memory. This makes insertion and deletion operations more flexible but requires careful pointer management.

Key points to keep in mind:

- The **head** points to the first element, and losing it can result in losing access to the entire list
- **Traversal** requires following `next` pointers until `null` is reached
- Linked lists can easily form **cycles**, which must be handled to avoid infinite loops
- Operations that are trivial in arrays, like accessing the i-th element, require **O(n)** traversal in linked lists

Understanding these fundamentals is crucial before diving into more advanced linked list patterns such as **two pointers**, **reversals**, and **cycle detection**.
