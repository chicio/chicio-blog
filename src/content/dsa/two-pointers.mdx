# Two Pointers Technique

## 1. Introduction
- What the Two Pointers technique is and why it exists.
- When and why it is better than naive nested loops (`O(n²)` → `O(n)`).
- Common use cases: searching, partitioning, deduplication, comparing extremes.
- **Note:** Sliding Window is related but will be discussed in its own article.

## 2. The Two Main Variants
- **Opposite-direction pointers (left–right):** pointers start at the ends and move inward.
- **Same-direction pointers (fast–slow):** both move in the same direction at different speeds.
- Guidelines on when to use each variant.

## 3. Classic Patterns

### 3.1 Sorted array + opposite pointers
- Efficient on sorted arrays for searching pairs or shrinking search space.
- Example: finding a target sum.
- Mini-diagram:

[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
L           R

### 3.2 Searching for optimal boundaries
- Problems requiring maximizing/minimizing areas, distances, or sums.
- Example: “Container With Most Water”.
- Diagram:

height[i]   height[j]
|         |
|         |
L–––––––R


### 3.3 Three Pointers / Extensions
- Extending to 3 pointers for problems like 3Sum.
- Deduplication in arrays or strings.
- Pivot + two-pointer approach.

### 3.4 Fast & Slow Pointers
- Detecting cycles in arrays or linked lists.
- Skipping duplicates efficiently.
- Finding midpoints.
- Diagram:

slow -> moves 1 step
fast -> moves 2 steps
cycle detection

## 4. Time & Space Complexity
- Reduces naive `O(n²)` to `O(n)` for most use cases.
- Requires sorted input for certain patterns.
- Space complexity: **O(1)** in almost all cases.
- Edge cases where it fails (unsorted input, complex conditions).

## 5. Common Pitfalls
- Forgetting the array must be sorted for certain variants.
- Integer overflow when calculating areas.
- Handling duplicates incorrectly.
- Confusing with Sliding Window (separate article).
