# Stacks

## 1. Introduction
- What a stack is: LIFO data structure
- Core operations: push, pop, peek
- When to use a stack

## 2. Classic Stack Patterns
- Matching / balancing (parentheses, duplicates)
- Parsing / evaluating expressions (RPN, calculator)
- Backtracking / undo patterns

## 3. Monotonic Stack
- Definition: a stack maintaining an increasing or decreasing invariant
- How it works: push while preserving order, pop when invariant violated
- Amortized O(n) guarantees
- Typical use cases: next greater/smaller, spans, max area/range

## 4. Common Tools and Techniques
- Frequency maps or auxiliary stacks if needed
- Maintaining invariants
- Running max/min while traversing
- Shrinking / expanding the stack conceptually

## 5. Time & Space Complexity
- Classic stack operations: O(1) time, O(n) space (for n elements)
- Monotonic stack: O(n) time (amortized), O(n) space
