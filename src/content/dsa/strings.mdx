# Strings

Strings are one of the most fundamental data types in computer science.  
They serve as the foundation for text processing, pattern recognition, and encoding/decoding operations in almost every system — from compilers to machine learning pipelines.

## What is a string?

A **string** is a sequence of characters, often represented as an array of `char` or a sequence of Unicode code points.
In most programming languages (including JavaScript and TypeScript), strings are **immutable** — meaning each modification produces a new string.

Example:

```typescript
let s = "hello";
s += " world"; // Creates a new string, not modifying the old one
```

This immutability affects both **time** and **space** complexity when manipulating strings.

## Operations and Time Complexity

Below are the common operations performed on string along with their average and worst-case time complexities:

| Operation       | Average Case | Worst Case |
|------------|--------------|-----------------|------------------|
| Indexing | Accessing `s[i]` | O(1) | O(1) |
| Concatenation | `s1 + s2` | O(n + m) | O(n + m) |
| Substring | `s.slice(i, j)` | O(k) | O(k) |
| Comparison | Check equality | O(n) | O(1) |
| Reversal | Reverse string | O(n) | O(n) |

## 3. Frequency Counting and Hash Maps

A frequent technique in string problems is **character frequency counting**, often used for:
- Checking **anagrams**
- Detecting **palindromes**
- Building **histograms** for text analysis

Example (TypeScript):

```typescript
function buildFrequencyMap(s: string): Record<string, number> {
  const freq: Record<string, number> = {};
  for (const char of s) {
    freq[char] = (freq[char] ?? 0) + 1;
  }
  return freq;
}
```

This technique runs in **O(n)** time and **O(1)** space (since alphabet size is bounded).


## Pattern Matching

Pattern matching involves searching for substrings within a larger text.

### Naïve Approach
- For each position, compare substring → **O(n × m)**  
- Simple but inefficient for long strings.

### Efficient Algorithms
- **KMP (Knuth–Morris–Pratt):** Preprocesses pattern using prefix table → **O(n + m)**
- **Rabin–Karp:** Hash-based matching → **O(n + m)** average, **O(n × m)** worst case
- **Boyer–Moore:** Skips portions of the text using heuristics → **O(n / m)** average

## Techniques

- **Reverse a string** (iterative or recursive)
- **Check palindrome**
- **Find first unique character**
- **Group anagrams**
- **Longest substring without repeating characters** (Sliding window — covered in a future article)

These problems test your understanding of:
- Hash maps (frequency)
- Two-pointer patterns
- String immutability
