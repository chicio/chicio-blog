# Time and Space Complexity

Understanding **time and space complexity** is essential for analyzing how algorithms scale.  
This article covers everything you need to know about time and space complexity, including worked examples, mathematical notations, and practical guidance.

## What is Algorithm Analysis?

When we talk about algorithms, one of the first questions that comes to mind is:  
**“How efficient is it?”**

This question is at the core of **algorithm analysis**, a branch of computer science that helps us understand how an algorithm behaves as the input size grows.  
Efficiency is not just about speed — it’s also about **how much memory an algorithm consumes** while running.  
That’s where **time complexity** and **space complexity** come in.

### Why Algorithm Analysis Matters

Two algorithms may solve the same problem, but one can be significantly faster or use much less memory than the other.  
For example, consider sorting: a simple algorithm like **Bubble Sort** may take several seconds to sort a large dataset, while **Merge Sort** or **Quick Sort** can handle it in a fraction of the time.  

Algorithm analysis provides a **mathematical framework** to predict how an algorithm will scale, without actually running it.  
This is especially critical when designing software that must handle **large-scale data** — think of web search engines, streaming platforms, or real-time financial systems.  
Even a small efficiency improvement can save **millions of operations** when applied at scale.

### Intuition Behind Time and Space Complexity

At its core, time complexity measures **how the number of operations grows** with respect to input size (denoted as `n`).  
Space complexity measures **how much extra memory** (RAM or stack) the algorithm requires to execute.

Here’s a simple analogy:
> Imagine you are packing boxes.  
> The **time complexity** tells you *how long it will take to pack all the boxes*,  
> while the **space complexity** tells you *how many packing tables you’ll need* to organize everything efficiently.

Both metrics are crucial.  
An algorithm that runs fast but consumes too much memory may still be unusable in memory-limited environments (like mobile devices or embedded systems).  
Conversely, an algorithm that is memory-efficient but slow may not meet performance requirements.

### Real-World Examples

- **Google Search:** must sort and rank billions of results in milliseconds.  
- **Navigation apps:** compute shortest paths (like Dijkstra’s algorithm) in real-time.  
- **Machine learning:** training models with millions of parameters requires careful optimization of time and space trade-offs.

In all these cases, developers use algorithmic analysis to **choose the best trade-off** between computation time and resource consumption.

## 1. Introduction

Algorithm analysis allows developers to **predict performance** and **compare solutions** without relying solely on code execution.  
It explains how runtime and memory usage grow as input size increases. Understanding complexity is key to optimizing algorithms and avoiding bottlenecks.

## 2. Time Complexity

Time complexity measures **how execution time grows with input size**. Key cases include:

- **Worst Case:** Maximum time an algorithm takes
- **Best Case:** Minimum time
- **Average Case:** Expected time over all inputs

### Big O, Ω, Θ Notations

- **O(f(n))**: upper bound, worst-case growth \(T(n) \leq c \cdot f(n)\)
- **Ω(f(n))**: lower bound, best-case growth \(T(n) \geq c \cdot f(n)\)
- **Θ(f(n))**: tight bound, exact asymptotic growth \(T(n) = Θ(f(n))\)

Example: Linear search
```python
def linear_search(arr, target):
    for i, x in enumerate(arr):
        if x == target:
            return i
    return -1
```
- Best case: O(1) (target at index 0)  
- Worst case: O(n) (target at end or absent)  
- Average case: O(n/2) → Θ(n)

### Typical Complexity Classes

| Complexity | Example Algorithms |
|------------|------------------|
| O(1) | Access array element, push/pop in stack |
| O(log n) | Binary search, balanced BST search |
| O(n) | Linear search, sum of array |
| O(n log n) | Merge Sort, Quick Sort average |
| O(n^2) | Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort |
| O(2^n) | Recursive Fibonacci, Subset sum |
| O(n!) | Travelling Salesman (brute force) |

## 3. Space Complexity

Space complexity measures **memory usage** relative to input size.

- Variables: O(1)  
- Arrays of size n: O(n)  
- Recursion stack: O(depth of recursion)  

Example: Recursive Fibonacci (Python)
```python
def fib(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)
```
- Time: O(2^n)  
- Space: O(n) due to recursion stack

## 4. Amortized Analysis

Some operations are expensive occasionally (e.g., dynamic array resizing).  
Amortized analysis averages cost over multiple operations.

Example: dynamic array push

Methods:
- Aggregate Method
- Accounting Method
- Potential Method

## 5. Recurrences and Master Theorem

Recursions are often represented as recurrences: \(T(n) = a T(n/b) + f(n)\)  

Master Theorem solves them quickly for divide-and-conquer algorithms.

Example: Merge Sort  
\(T(n) = 2T(n/2) + Θ(n) → Θ(n log n)\)

## 6. Tail Recursion

Tail recursion allows **constant stack usage**. Example:

```python
def factorial(n, acc=1):
    if n == 0:
        return acc
    return factorial(n-1, n*acc)
```
- Space complexity: O(1) (tail call optimization)  

Example languages: Java, C++, Python, TypeScript, Swift, Kotlin

## 7. Dynamic Programming Complexity Breakdown

DP problems can be analyzed using a grid/matrix for **subproblem storage**. Example: 0/1 Knapsack, Fibonacci, Grid paths.

{/* <DPGrid /> */}

- Time: O(number of subproblems * cost per subproblem)  
- Space: O(number of subproblems)  

Worked example: Fibonacci DP
```python
def fib_dp(n):
    dp = [0]*(n+1)
    dp[1] = 1
    for i in range(2, n+1):
        dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2]
    return dp[n]
```
- Time: O(n)  
- Space: O(n)

## 8. Practical Interview-style Examples

Step-by-step calculation of time and space is critical in interviews. Example approaches:
- Count operations inside loops and recursions
- Identify dominant terms
- Consider nested loops and multiple recursive calls
