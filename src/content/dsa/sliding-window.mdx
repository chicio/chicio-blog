# Sliding Window

1. Introduction
	•	What the Sliding Window pattern solves
	•	When to use it (recognizing sliding window problems)
	•	Differences vs brute force O(n²) approaches

2. Sliding Window vs Two Pointers
	•	Conceptual differences
	•	Relationship between the two patterns
	•	When to use one vs the other

3. Types of Sliding Window

3.1 Fixed-Size Sliding Window
	•	Definition
	•	How it works
	•	Typical problem signals
	•	General template

3.2 Dynamic-Size Sliding Window
	•	Definition
	•	How it works (expand → validate → shrink)
	•	Typical constraints and invariants
	•	General template

4. Common Sliding Window Tools
	•	Frequency maps
	•	Running counters (sum, max, distinct counts, matches)
	•	Window validity conditions
	•	Strategies for shrinking the window

5. How to Recognize Sliding Window Problems
	•	Patterns in problem statements
	•	Key questions to identify the correct sliding window variant

6. Common Mistakes and How to Avoid Them
	•	Off-by-one errors
	•	Incorrect shrink conditions
	•	Mismanaging counts or frequencies
	•	Forgetting to update best results at the right moment

7. Time and Space Complexity
	•	Complexity of fixed-size windows
	•	Complexity of dynamic windows
	•	Why sliding window is almost always O(n)
