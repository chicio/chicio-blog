# Videogames 

Videogames have always been an important part of my life. As I mentioned in my short biography, I started playing at a very young age, and that passion has grown with me over time.

With the exception of a brief period between 2019 and 2023 when I stopped playing, videogames have been a constant presence in my life. In fact, they were one of the main reasons that pushed me to study computer science and eventually become a software engineer.

Through games, I learned how to think logically, how to approach complex problems, and how to collaborate with others. They taught me far more than I realized at the time.
To me, videogames are a form of interactive art, a unique blend of graphics (one of the areas of computer science I’m most passionate about), music (another great passion of mine), 
storytelling, and gameplay, all combined into immersive and meaningful experiences.

I am a big fan of many genres, especially role-playing games, platformers, and action titles, though I also enjoy puzzle games and shooters.
Even though the industry is steadily moving toward digital distribution, I still prefer buying physical copies and as long as they exist, 
I will continue to do so. 

Over the years, I have built a collection of consoles and games that mainly revolves around Nintendo and Sony. 
Nintendo gave me my very first game and consoles, and brought me back to gaming in 2023, while Sony has accompanied me throughout my entire journey as a gamer.

This section is a showcase of that journey.
