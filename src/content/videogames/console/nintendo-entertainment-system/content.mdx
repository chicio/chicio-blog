## My Story with NES

I received the NES by sheer luck. It was the winter of 1992, and at the time I owned only one console, the one that had introduced me 
to the world of video games: the [Gameboy](/videogames/console/gameboy). Fortunately, I had a cousin who was also passionate about video games, 
but at some point she decided to "get rid" of her NES.  

My parents agreed to buy it, and from that moment until the [Playstation](/videogames/console/playstation1), the NES was my main home console.  
I spent days playing [Super Mario Bros 3](/videogames/console/nintendo-entertainment-system/game/super-mario-bros-3), [Faxanadu](/videogames/console/nintendo-entertainment-system/game/faxanadu), 
[Mario and Yoshi](/videogames/console/nintendo-entertainment-system/game/mario-and-yoshi), and [Track & Field In Barcelona](/videogames/console/nintendo-entertainment-system/game/track-and-field).

I wore out one of the two controllers I had so much that, in the end, one tore. I still own it, patched up with electrical tape to hold it together.  
It remains, however, a memory of a wonderful period, when my passion for computing started to emerge, thanks in part to the NES.

## <MDXTitleWithIcon icon={<FaLightbulb className="text-shadow-lg" />}>Trivia & Fun Facts</MDXTitleWithIcon>

- The NES was intentionally designed to look like a VCR rather than a video game console. This was a strategic move by Nintendo to avoid the stigma associated with video games at the time, especially after the video game crash of 1983.
- The NES was released in Japan as the Famicom (Family Computer) in 1983, and it has been supported until 2003, making it one of the longest-supported consoles in history.
- The entire library of over 700 licensed NES games is roughly 237 MBs, smaller than a single, high-definition YouTube video. It could easily fit on a modern USB stick.
