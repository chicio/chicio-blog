## <MDXTitleWithIcon icon={<FaStar className="text-shadow-lg" />}>My Review</MDXTitleWithIcon>

Based on the RoboCop franchise, this NES game made me spend entire afternoons with a mix of joy and frustration. Perhaps because of my age, perhaps because I was inexperienced,  
I remember this game as one of the most difficult I faced back then.  

In fact, the game is a beat 'em up with platforming elements, where you control RoboCop, the famous cyborg police officer, who must face various enemies and bosses (also taken from the movie)  
to complete the levels. The real challenge of the game, for me personally, was in the aiming and shooting mechanics, as well as managing enemy jumps.

The game arrived in my collection many years after its release. It was a gift  
for my seventh birthday. Despite the gameplay difficulties, I keep it with affection in my collection.

- Energy as Batteries: Unlike many NES games where you only lose health when hit, RoboCop's health constantly depletes just by moving, mimicking a robot running on a limited battery life.
- Cinematic Loyalty: The NES version is widely considered more faithful to the 1987 film's plot than other ports. It includes specific scenes like the City Hall standoff and even lets you confront the primary villain, Clarence Boddicker, who was missing from several other versions.
