## <MDXTitleWithIcon icon={<FaStar className="text-shadow-lg" />}>My Review</MDXTitleWithIcon>

This is a game purchased in 1992 by my sister, again where there was a clearance sale of NES 
games (the same for which I purchased [Maniac Mansion](/videogames/console/nintendo-entertainment-system/game/maniac-mansion))). She wanted to to play something on the home 
console, after she purchased her first Gameboy.

I played this only a couple of times, and I don't remember much about it. I will give it a try one day.

- Due to Mattel's reluctance to let Barbie be animated in any "unladylike" or unflattering way, she could not jump on or directly fight enemies. 
Instead, she maintains a specific walking pose and uses a magic charm bracelet to command animals and objects in the environment to perform actions for her.
