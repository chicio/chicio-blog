## <MDXTitleWithIcon icon={<FaStar className="text-shadow-lg" />}>My Review</MDXTitleWithIcon>

This game is the first sport one I ever bought. This is a republished version of the original [Track & Field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_%26_Field_(video_game)) for the 
Summer Olympics of 1992. 
The game most involves alternately pressing one/two buttons as quickly as possible to make the onscreen character run faster.

The game uses a horizontal side-scrolling format, displaying one or two tracks at a time, a large scoreboard that shows world records and current attempts, 
and a packed audience in the background.  

This is one of such game that can destroy your fingers and your controllers :laughing:.

- The game features an 8-bit rendition of the "Chariots of Fire" theme by Vangelis as its opening song, just like the arcade original
