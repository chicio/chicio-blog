Mario & Yoshi is one of the first puzzle games I ever played. This is a falling block game in which the player is given a playing field that is divided into four columns. 
The objective is to match Yoshi egg shells to hatch them and prevent the four stacks, which pile up from the falling monsters, from growing too tall. 

The player character, Mario, swaps the stacks around such that the falling monsters will be eliminated by coming into contact with the blocks they match.
Monsters, which consist of various Mario enemies, appear at the top of the screen and fall into each the columns, turning into blocks as they land and creating stacks that incrementally grow in height. The main objective is to prevent the four stacks from growing too high by eliminating blocks from the field

This is one of the few games also enjoyed by my mom. In fact, it is one of the few (along with Super Mario Bros 3) that we played together :heart:.
