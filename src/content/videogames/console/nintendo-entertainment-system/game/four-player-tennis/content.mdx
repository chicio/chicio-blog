## <MDXTitleWithIcon icon={<FaStar className="text-shadow-lg" />}>My Review</MDXTitleWithIcon>

This game is the second sport one I ever bought. 
I bought it at the same time of RoboCop  at a shopping mall near my home during a clearance sale (for 19,000 lire).
The most fun part of the game is the multiplayer mode, where you can compete with friends in various tennis events. 

The game features simple controls and colorful graphics, making it enjoyable for players of all ages.

- It is one of the very few games on the NES to support true four-player simultaneous gameplay
