This was one of the first games I got after purchasing the console. Just like [RoboCop](/videogames/console/nintendo-entertainment-system/game/robocop), this game  
made me sweat a lot, especially in the early levels. I still remember the frustration of trying to land the plane on the platform without crashing :laughing:.

There is both a career mode, where you have to complete a series of missions, and a multiplayer mode to challenge a friend.  
For its time, it was technically impressive, with detailed graphics and engaging gameplay.

- The "Unsolvable" Ending: the European version contains a hidden Congratulations Screen that only appears if you get a "Game Over" after scoring at least 50,000 points and by pressing a specific buttons combination.
