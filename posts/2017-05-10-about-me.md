_It's me, Fabrizio Duroni: a software developer passionate about his work and a lover of computer graphics.  
Another blog, you say? Hopefully, this one won't be boring._

Hello! I'm Fabrizio Duroni. I live in Como, Italy with my family, my girlfriend Chiara, and a lot of computers.  
I fell in love with technology when I was 7, after receiving my first [Game Boy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Boy "Game Boy") for Christmas. I still remember the first day I played [Super Mario Land 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Mario_Land_2:_6_Golden_Coins "Super Mario Land 2") — it was truly amazing.

My journey continued with another console, the [Nintendo NES](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_Entertainment_System "Nintendo NES"). Just to be clear, video games are one of my main hobbies. After the first two Nintendo consoles, I became a PlayStation fan and have owned every Sony console released since 1995.  

I got my first PC when I was 10, equipped with an AMD K5 processor (no Intel Pentium?!!! 😮) and 64 MB of RAM. I remember experimenting with it and discovering new things about computer science every day.  

I started programming at 14, beginning with Pascal in high school, then moving on to **C, Java, and PHP** during my bachelor's degree. In 2009, I fell in love with Apple 📱, and in 2010 I started developing iOS applications. That's why I’m passionate about **Swift** and **Objective-C**.  

Around the same time, I started my _internal struggle_ over which platform is best — Apple, Microsoft, or Linux — a debate that still isn’t over 😅.

In 2013, I started my master’s degree, specializing in **computer graphics**, the area of computer science I love most. This is also when I fell in love with **C++**. I’m also proficient in **JavaScript** and **TypeScript**.  

If you want to read more about my journey in computer science, visit my [homepage](/ "homepage").  

I consider myself an experienced developer who enjoys his work immensely. Programming is both a challenge and a way to connect with brilliant people every day.

### **By the way, what does “Chicio” mean?**

Chicio is my nickname for as long as I can remember. Everyone calls me that, and sometimes I almost forget it’s not my real name. Its origin remains a mystery 😜, but I really like it.

### **Why start a blog?**

I started this blog in 2017 to keep track of my progress in programming, computer graphics, and computer science in general. We’re still up and running — a testament to my perseverance. Once I start something, I never quit!

### **Why “The Matrix”?**

Do I need to explain? It’s one of the greatest movies of all time! 😏 I even have the famous blue and red pills tattooed on my wrists.

Over time, this website has evolved through several updates. I always wanted a “cool” portfolio site but feared it might seem childish. Now, time and self-confidence have helped me overcome that fear.  

The concept of *choice to seek and embrace the truth, even if it is harsh, difficult, and uncomfortable, symbolizing awakening and enlightenment* resonates deeply with me. Life sometimes feels like a cage, but we should strive to be unplugged.

### **Is there life beyond computer science?**

Of course — Chiara, the most important person in my life 💘.  

I love music, especially rock and metal, and I attend many concerts. I also tried playing bass guitar for a few years, though not very successfully 😄.  

Tattoos? I have many, covering arms, legs, back, and chest 😏.  

And yes, I still love video games. I’m a huge fan of everything Sony and Nintendo create (sorry Microsoft, I’ve never been an Xbox fan 😆).

That’s it for the presentation. I hope you’re not bored.  
Enjoy your read!
